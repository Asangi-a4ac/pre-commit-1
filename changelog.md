## 0.1.3

### Bugs
* On the debugger check, only checking the lines that the committer has added.

### Enhancements
* Adding a reminder that the pre-commit check can be bypassed using `git commit -n`

## 0.1.2

### Bugs
* The tabs check was detecting leading tabs in binary files. The tabs check no longer checks binary files. (thanks to morten for pointing this out)
